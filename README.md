Developing a bicycling infrastructure classification system for Greater Melbourne using OpenStreetMap

Policy-makers are looking to promote the uptake of bicycling as a healthy mode of travel that reduces the negative effects of traditional motorised transport (physical inactivity, air pollution, traffic congestion) and achieves sustainability goals. 
As an active form of mobility, bicycling improves physical and mental health and has long-term public health benefits.
However, there are a number of barriers that prevent people from riding a bike, including fears about riding alongside motor vehicle traffic and the lack of safe and appropriate bicycling infrastructure. 
For the strategic installation of safer bicycling infrastructure or the improvement of existing infrastructure, and the implementation of pro-bicycling policies in general, rigorous evidence-informed scientific studies are necessary, which in turn relies on high-quality bicycling data, which is scarce.
